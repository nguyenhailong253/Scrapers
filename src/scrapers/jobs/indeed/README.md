# How it works
- First get all subcategories in a dictionary, with subcate name as key, subcate url as value
- Iterate through all key-value pair
- Each subcate will have multiple pages => for each subcate, iterate through each page

# Rules
- Sponsored by seems to have changed: "Sponsored by Bayside Group"
